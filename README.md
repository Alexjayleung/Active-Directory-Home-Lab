1. **Installing VirtualBox and Obtaining ISO Files**: Download and install Oracle VirtualBox. Obtain the Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 ISO files for creating virtual machines (VMs). 

2. **Creating the Domain Controller VM**: Set up a VM for Windows Server 2019, configuring two network adaptersâ€”one set to NAT for internet access and another to Internal Network for internal communication.

3. **Installing and Configuring Active Directory**: Install the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role on the Windows Server 2019 VM, promote it to a domain controller, and create a new domain. 

4. **Setting Up Routing and Remote Access**: Configure the Routing and Remote Access role to enable Network Address Translation (NAT), allowing client machines on the internal network to access the internet through the domain controller.

5. **Configuring DHCP**: Install and configure the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) role on the domain controller to assign IP addresses to client machines automatically. 

6. **Automating User Account Creation with PowerShell**: Use a PowerShell script to create multiple user accounts in Active Directory, streamlining the process of populating the domain with users.

<br />

7. **Setting Up a Windows 10 Client VM**: Create a Windows 10 VM, configure its network settings to connect to the internal network, and join it to the newly created domain. 

8. **Verifying Domain Functionality**: Log in to the Windows 10 client using one of the domain user accounts to confirm successful integration and functionality of the Active Directory environment.
